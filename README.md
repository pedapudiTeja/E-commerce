## üöÄ Deployment

The project is designed for easy deployment on **Vercel**.

### Vercel Deployment Steps

1.  **Project Structure**: The repository is organized into `admin`, `backend`, and `frontend` folders.
2.  **Vercel Configuration (`vercel.json`)**:
    *   A `vercel.json` file is present in the `backend` folder for Express.js backend configuration.
    *   `vercel.json` files are also in the `frontend` and `admin` folders to support React Router.
3.  **Git Ignore (`.gitignore`)**: Includes `node_modules` and `.env` files to prevent sensitive data and unnecessary files from being pushed to GitHub.
4.  **GitHub Upload**: The entire project (excluding ignored files) is uploaded to a GitHub repository.
5.  **Vercel Import**:
    *   Link your GitHub account to Vercel.
    *   Import the GitHub repository as a new project on Vercel.
    *   For each sub-project (backend, frontend, admin), specify the **root directory** (e.g., `/backend`, `/frontend`, `/admin`).
6.  **Environment Variables**:
    *   Provide all necessary **environment variables** (e.g., `MONGODB_URI`, `JWT_SECRET`, `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`, `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `VITE_BACKEND_URL`) in Vercel's project settings.
    *   The `VITE_BACKEND_URL` for frontend and admin panels should point to the deployed backend URL from Vercel.
7.  **Deploy**: Initiate the deployment process for each sub-project.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Local Development Setup

To set up and run the project locally:

1.  **Prerequisites**:
    *   Node.js (LTS recommended)
    *   npm (Node Package Manager) or Yarn
    *   A MongoDB Atlas account (for database setup).
    *   A Cloudinary account (for image hosting).
    *   Stripe developer accounts (if testing online payments).
2.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <your-project-folder>
    ```
3.  **Backend Setup**:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install
    # Create a .env file and add your MongoDB_URI, JWT_SECRET, Cloudinary API keys, Stripe keys, and admin credentials.
    # Example .env content:
    # MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.abcde.mongodb.net/ecommerce?retryWrites=true&w=majority
    # JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
    # CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
    # CLOUDINARY_SECRET_KEY=your_cloudinary_secret_key
    # CLOUDINARY_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
    # ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@example.com
    # ADMIN_PASSWORD=adminpassword
    # STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key
    npm run server # Starts the backend server with nodemon
    ```
4.  **Frontend Setup**:
    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    npm install
    # Create a .env file and add your backend URL
    # Example .env content:
    # VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:4000
    npm run dev # Starts the frontend React app
    ```
5.  **Admin Panel Setup**:
    ```bash
    cd ../admin
    npm install
    # Create a .env file and add your backend URL
    # Example .env content:
    # VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:4000
    npm run dev # Starts the admin panel React app
    ```

Ensure all three (backend, frontend, admin) are running simultaneously in separate terminal windows for full functionality.
